# gulp-boiler

Gulp-based boilerplate for quickly setting up development environment for new sites.

It is not meant to be a framework, but a set of basic front-end task wrapped in a neat package. The included HTML, SASS components are only for illustration and are highly opinionated.


## Dependencies

Your machinery needs to have following installed:

- Node
- Gulp

## Install

Make a new directory for your project and copy the contents of this repository to it.

To install all the dependencies run ```npm install``` in a terminal and you are ready to go.


## Usage

Simply run ```gulp``` and code away.
 

If you want to run some of the tasks individually just run ```gulp [name-of-the-task]```

For more details and task names check the ```gulpfile.js```

## Development

I use the boilerplate for personal projects. The code is far from eloquent, but it gets the job done and I am glad if others find a use for it as well.

Feedback and pull request with improvements are welcomed.
